# Echoes Beyond 🌌🗣️

**"Where memories meet technology."**

Echoes Beyond is a pioneering platform that uses cutting-edge AI to recreate the voices, likeness, and conversational patterns of people who have passed away — enabling virtual video call interactions that feel deeply personal, emotional, and meaningful.

## 🧠 What is Echoes Beyond?

Echoes Beyond is an AI-driven platform designed to simulate realistic video call conversations with digital recreations of deceased individuals. Using a blend of machine learning, voice synthesis, facial animation, and memory modeling, we aim to offer comfort, closure, and companionship to those left behind.

We do this by:
- Reconstructing personality traits through personal data (videos, texts, social media, etc.)
- Using generative models to create lifelike video avatars
- Simulating voice patterns and emotional tones
- Enabling private, secure video calls where users can converse with the AI version of a lost loved one

> **Note**: This project respects the ethical boundaries of digital remembrance and gives users full control over the data and usage.
